# Faduma Abdi Portfolio

## Project Description

This project is my portfolio page which I will be able to add to as my experience grows. 

The aim is for potential clients to know who I am, showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time postion. The portfolio page will highlight my strongest work as well as the though process behind it. Placeholder images and names have been used and will be replaced with future work.


## Usage

This is currently a single-page responsive website which is optimised for larger and smaller screens.

Navigation bars at the top right corner of the website allow a user to navigate through the site to each section they would like to read.

Each placeholder image in the work section can be clicked. This will in future redirect a user to the deployed project.
